Welcome to the Rapptr Labs To-Do App!

To get started, run `npm install` and `npm start`. When the app loads, type in your login information and have fun! You will be able to create, edit and delete tasks. When you log out from the app, your tasks will presist into your next session.

Enjoy and happy new year!
